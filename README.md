George created the Navbar and Header for the Landing Page and How it Works, as well as the Main section on the How it Works page. All of this was done using only Bootstrap .

Jerome completed the Main section(start to explore, payments with ease and Soultions to fit)sections on the Landing Page and the Sign Up page using bootstrap and media queries as well as added my own .css style page to make adjustments.

Brie completed the footers for both pages, as well as the Sign-In Page.
